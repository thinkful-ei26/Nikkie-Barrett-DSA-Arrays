So to get to the address of the nth item you simply have to 
add n to the memory address of the start of the data. ?????

What is head in memory.allocate?

_resize?

What is ptr doing? ptr arithmetic

The push method resizes the array, then increases the length and sets
a single memory address (both O(1) operations). So push is also O(n). 
Why?
 

in Retrieving values.. All this does is add an index offset, and get the value stored at a memory address.?? 

in arr.insert() why memory.copy(this.ptr + index + 1, this.ptr + index, this.length - index);
sepecifically arg 3
